# Permissions

Describes the permissions levels that a user has for permissioned features. When the client sends this, Permissions.read and Permissions.write are the additional permissions granted to a user on top of what they have via their roles.
When the server sends this, Permissions.read and Permissions.write are the complete (merged) set of permissions the user has, and Permissions.roles is just for display purposes.

## Example Usage

```typescript
import { Permissions } from "@gleanwork/api-client/models/components";

let value: Permissions = {};
```
